# FreshFridge
## Project Description
Kivy App that keeps track of items in fridge
### Inspiration
I would always try and check the fridge for food but the fridge would contain food that has already gone bad, so I made an app that keeps track of the food in your fridge.
### How I built it
I used the kivy python frame work for the front end and python for the back end
## How to install and run the project
1. Install Python
2. Run `pip install kivy` in the terminal
3. Run the code
## How to use project
1. Create an account and login
2. Click the buttons around the app and add food items and remove them
